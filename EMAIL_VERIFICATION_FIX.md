# Email Verification Fix - Complete Solution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Registration Auto-Login Issue
**Problem**: After registration, users were automatically logged in without email verification.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `server/controllers/auth.controller.js` to not send JWT token on registration
- Updated response to include `requiresVerification: true` and `userId`
- Modified `client/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` to handle verification requirement
- Updated `client/src/services/auth.service.js` to not store token/user on registration
- Fixed `client/src/pages/Register.jsx` to properly redirect to verification page

### 2. Email Service Configuration Issue
**Problem**: Emails were not being sent because the service was using Ethereal (fake SMTP) and missing email configuration.

**Solution**:
- Added email configuration to `server/.env`
- Modified `server/services/email.service.js` to use real SMTP when configured
- Fixed transporter initialization to properly configure handlebars

## Email Configuration Setup

### Step 1: Configure Gmail SMTP (Recommended)
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and generate a password
   - Copy the 16-character password

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
Edit `server/.env` and replace the placeholder values:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail SMTP)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your_actual_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
EMAIL_FROM="LinkBzaar" <noreply@linkbzaar.com>
```

### Step 3: Alternative Email Providers

#### For Outlook/Hotmail:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your_email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
```

#### For Yahoo:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your_email@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

## How It Works Now

### Registration Flow:
1. User fills registration form
2. Backend creates user with `isEmailVerified: false`
3. Backend generates OTP and saves to database
4. Backend sends verification email
5. Backend responds with `requiresVerification: true` and `userId`
6. Frontend redirects to `/verify-email` page
7. User enters OTP from email
8. Backend verifies OTP and marks email as verified
9. User is logged in and redirected to home

### Login Flow for Unverified Users:
1. User tries to login
2. Backend checks if email is verified
3. If not verified, generates new OTP and sends email
4. Backend responds with `requiresVerification: true`
5. Frontend redirects to verification page
6. User completes verification process

## Testing the Fix

### Test Registration:
1. Register a new account with a real email address
2. Check that you're redirected to verification page (not logged in)
3. Check your email for the OTP code
4. Enter the OTP to complete verification
5. Verify you're logged in after successful verification

### Test Login with Unverified Account:
1. Create an account but don't verify email
2. Try to login with those credentials
3. Check that you're redirected to verification page
4. Check email for new OTP
5. Complete verification process

## Troubleshooting

### If emails are not being received:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify email configuration in `.env`
3. Check server console for email sending logs
4. Ensure Gmail App Password is correct (not regular password)

### If verification page doesn't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the route is properly configured
3. Check that `userId` and `email` are passed in navigation state

### If OTP verification fails:
1. Check that OTP hasn't expired (10 minutes)
2. Verify OTP is exactly 6 digits
3. Check database to see if OTP matches

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `server/.env` - Added email configuration
- `server/controllers/auth.controller.js` - Fixed registration response
- `server/services/email.service.js` - Fixed email service initialization

### Frontend:
- `client/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - Fixed registration and login handling
- `client/src/services/auth.service.js` - Fixed registration token handling
- `client/src/pages/Register.jsx` - Fixed redirect logic

## Security Notes

- OTP expires after 10 minutes
- New OTP is generated on each login attempt for unverified users
- Email verification is required for all local authentication users
- Google OAuth users bypass email verification (already verified by Google)
